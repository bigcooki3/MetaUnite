# MetaUnite
An augmented reality lesson on Unity game development, developed for the Meta 2 headset.

Created for my undergraduate research from January to April 2018, this app teaches the user the basics of Unity game development in augmented reality using interactive models that can be touched and modified, and teaches lessons on Unity basics. These include GameObjects and their properties, attaching scripts, world transform and manipulating it with vectors, and Unity physics using rigidbodies and colliders. 

The app was developed in Unity Engine 2017.3, and was written using C# and the Meta 2 SDK 2.6.0.

The builds of this game are not included, but you can build this game simply by opening it in Unity 2017.3 and building it for Windows x86_64, as the Meta 2 is incompatible with all other OS and architectures. To run the game simple double click the built application and ensure you have a set up Meta 2 headset with the latest SDK and drivers installed.
